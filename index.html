            <div class="content-body">
                <p>The handbook explores project-based learning (PBL) from a project management (PM) perspective, arguing that successful PBL requires commitment to both student learning and well-structured, well-managed project execution. It highlights that many elements of PBL, especially the phases, are adapted from professional PM practices.</p>

                <p>The author directly addresses the following professional PM knowledge areas with students:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scope Management:</strong> Delineating project requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Resource Management:</strong> Leading or working with a project team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stakeholder Management:</strong> Working with a project client or sponsor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communications Management:</strong> Keeping everyone informed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Managing time and/or creating schedules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Planning for and managing project risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Management:</strong> Ensuring the project leads to quality outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The internationally recognized standards for professional project management are maintained by the Project Management Institute (PMI) in <em>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK¬Æ Guide)</em>.</p>

                        <p>PBL is a collaborative inquiry teaching approach where students work in teams on a curriculum-based project with real-world connections, guided by a <strong>driving question</strong>.</p>

                        <p>The definition is: <strong>Project-based learning empowers learners to collaborate in teams, mentored by their instructors, as they research real-world questions, pose solutions to real-world problems, and design real-world products in a rigorous way.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PBL as an 'Instructional Umbrella':</strong> It's not a panacea but can serve as a framework for employing a wide range of instructional strategies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Key components:</strong> It <strong>empowers</strong> students by shifting control; <strong>reconceptualizes students as learners</strong>; emphasizes <strong>collaboration in teams</strong>; requires instructors to act as <strong>mentors/facilitators</strong>; focuses on <strong>real-world questions</strong> and <strong>problems</strong>; and demands a <strong>rigorous</strong> process tied to curriculum standards.</li>

                        <p>Seven project phases, adapted from PM, scaffold the learning:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Preparing:</strong> Structuring lessons, activities, and discussions to teach students pre-requisite content and PM skills (e.g., group development, communication, roles, scheduling, best practices).</li>
                            <li><strong>Initiating:</strong> Summarizing a feasible project idea, defining the scope, and securing authorization to proceed (often via a <strong>mini-proposal</strong>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Detailing the project plans and securing stakeholder support, resulting in a formal <strong>Project Proposal</strong> (the project plan).</li>
                            <li><strong>Executing</strong> and <strong>5. Assessing (in tandem):</strong> Carrying out the project while continuously monitoring its progress to ensure success. Project teams track, report, and assess progress against the plan.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>The Triple-M Cycle</strong> (<em>Manage, Monitor, Modify</em>) is a developed process for continuous monitoring: <strong>Tracking</strong> (documentation), <strong>Reporting</strong> (communication), and <strong>Assessing</strong> (evaluation, leading to modification).</li>

                            <li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Disseminating the final product(s) to a public audience, underscoring the real-world focus and increasing the stakes for students.</li>
                            <li><strong>Closing:</strong> Bringing the project to a structured end, including securing sign-off from the sponsor (if applicable), archiving project assets, and documenting best practices and lessons learned through reflection.</li>

                        <p>A project can be initiated by the <strong>instructor</strong>, <strong>students</strong>, or an <strong>external sponsor</strong>. The locus of control is often related to who initiates the project:</p>

                            <li><strong>Instructor-Initiated:</strong> Instructor retains a high degree of control, ideal for training students in PBL or tightly aligning with curriculum.</li>

                        <p>The most compelling projects are often driven by the need to solve or address a social or scientific problem, described as a <strong>problematic situation</strong> (a concept from John Dewey). This is a disequilibrium that triggers a need for new learning and propels student inquiry throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
